# React useReduce Hook

`useReduce` is a built-in React hook that provides a way to manage state in functional components. It is an alternative to the more commonly used `useState` hook and allows for more complex state management.



## What is useReduce?

`useReduce` is a hook that is used to manage state in functional components. It takes two arguments: a reducer function and an initial state value.



The reducer function is responsible for updating the state based on actions that are dispatched to it. Actions are objects that have a type and a payload. The reducer function takes the current state and the action as arguments and returns the new state.



The initial state value is the starting point for the state. It can be any value, such as an object, array, or primitive.



## When should you use useReduce?

`useReduce` is useful when you need to manage complex state that involves multiple variables or when you need to perform complex state updates based on user interactions.

It is also useful when you have multiple components that need to share state. By lifting the state up to a common ancestor component and passing down the state and dispatch function as props, you can ensure that all components are working with the same state.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use `useReduce`:

```
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}

```

In this example, we define an initial state with a `count` property set to 0. We also define a reducer function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state based on the action.

We then use the `useReducer` hook to create a state and dispatch function based on the reducer and initial state. We use these in the component to display the current count and buttons to increment and decrement the count.

## Conclusion

`useReduce` is a powerful tool for managing complex state in functional components. By providing a reducer function and an initial state value, you can create a state and dispatch function that can handle complex state updates based on actions. If you find yourself struggling to manage state with `useState`, consider using `useReduce` instead.
